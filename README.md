# Demand Forecasting Walmart
Welcome to our repository, where we present our project aimed at forecasting the sales of a retail store.

The first step of our project was to analyze and process the data in order to make it suitable for input to machine learning models. Then, we applied various machine learning models to find the best fit, and optimized their hyperparameters.

We performed the model training and validation process twice, once using features describing the promotions and once without, in order to observe the influence of promotions on the performance of the models.

In this repository, you will find all the necessary code, documentation, and datasets used in our project. We have also included a detailed report that outlines our methodology and presents our findings.

Our aim with this project is to provide valuable insights for retail stores looking to improve their sales forecasting. We invite you to explore our repository and see how machine learning can be applied to real-world business problems.
